Sydney's Making Code Notes

This repo is for Laijy's code ported into QMake, sorta.

This is me taking notes on what I can figure out of Laijy's code
Not commented in the actual files quite yet to avoid issues with needing to merge

All the code is a global namespace, hence the :: before each function/method/class call.

Note the original main.cpp and main header (called pch.hpp) is missing from this repo.

General Project Flow, as I can figure it out:
For main.cpp (not included)
    Product is created in main.cpp
        Product creates a database containing cart items
            Database uses SQLite
    Screen is created within the window
    Keyboard is linked to the screen/window
    Window is executed
        If window fails to run, returns whatever error number, which in turn is returned by main.cpp


Specific files and their functionalities

"POS/Product.hpp" and "POS/Product.cpp" (WIP)
Class: Product
    Static Method: getFromDataBase()
        Returns a searched product from a database, passing the id to search and the db to search
        Return format: Product (the class data type)
    Constructor:
        Takes the item id, name, price, and quantity

"POS/UI/ProductContainer.cpp" (WIP)
Holds products



    ===REALIZED WE MIGHT NOT NEED THESE BUT HERE FOR LATER REFERENCE====

"DB/ADatabase.hpp" and "DB/ADatabase.cpp" (WIP)
Class: ADatabase
    Constructor takes the name of the database and a path to place the database
    Operations to add/delete entries

"DB/Products.hpp" and "DB/Products.cpp" (WIP)
Class: Products
    Constructor takes name and path
    Getting the products list returns a pointer to the location
