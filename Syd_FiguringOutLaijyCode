This repo is for Laijy's code ported into QMake, sorta.

I've commented all of the code as I can figure it out, for reference as we try to integrate
Tried to list all my notes as "Syd: [NOTE]" but if I forget to do that now you know.

If I've commented at all within a file, I put so at the top.

Note Laijy's original main.cpp and main header (called pch.hpp) is missing from this repo.

General Project Flow, as I can figure it out:
For main.cpp (not included)
    Program begins running
    Product is created in main.cpp
        Product creates a database containing cart items
    Screen is created within the window
    Keyboard is linked to the screen/window
    Window is executed (as a return statement)
        If window fails to run, returns whatever error number, which in turn is returned by main.cpp
